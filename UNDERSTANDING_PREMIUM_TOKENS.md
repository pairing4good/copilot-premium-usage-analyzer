# Understanding GitHub Copilot Premium Tokens

## What Are Premium Tokens?

GitHub Copilot offers two tiers:

- **Standard Copilot**: Inline code completions and basic autocomplete suggestions
- **Copilot Premium**: Advanced AI capabilities through a token-based quota system — **300 tokens per seat per month**

Each premium token represents access to powerful features that extend far beyond basic autocomplete.

## What Premium Tokens Enable

Premium tokens power **GitHub Copilot Chat** and autonomous agent features:

### 🔍 Interactive AI Pair Programming
- Deep code understanding and architectural analysis
- Advanced development tasks (generation, refactoring, testing, debugging)
- Multi-file, repository-wide context awareness
- Access to premium AI models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

### 🤖 Autonomous Agent Features
- **Copilot Code Review**: Automated PR analysis with security scanning and actionable suggestions
- **Copilot Coding Agent**: Assign issues to @copilot for autonomous bug fixes, features, and documentation

## Why This Matters

**Premium tokens = AI developer capacity.** Each seat provides **75 hours of AI-assisted development per month** (300 tokens × 15 minutes).

- **For a 10-person team**: 750 hours/month of AI capacity included in your licenses
- **Unused tokens reset monthly** — they cannot be carried forward
- **You've already paid for this capacity** with your Premium licenses

## ⚠️ Critical: Premium Features Must Be Enabled

**Premium capabilities are disabled by default.** Even if your organization pays for Premium licenses, developers cannot access these features until enabled.

### If Premium Features Are Disabled:
- ❌ Developers only get basic autocomplete
- ❌ No Copilot Chat or conversational AI
- ❌ No premium AI models
- ❌ **300 tokens per seat go completely unused**
- ❌ **You're paying Premium prices for Standard functionality**

### How to Enable Premium Features

Organization administrators should:

1. **Enable Copilot Chat**: GitHub org settings → Copilot → Enable "Copilot Chat in the IDE"
2. **Enable Premium Models**: Allow access to premium AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
3. **Communicate to Developers**: Ensure teams know features are available in their IDE
4. **Monitor Usage**: Use this analyzer to track adoption and ROI

> **💰 ROI Reality Check**  
> You've already paid for 300 premium requests per developer per month. Zero usage = 100% waste of your Premium investment.

## The Bottom Line

Premium tokens represent your team's capacity to leverage AI for complex development tasks. This analyzer helps you measure how effectively you're using this pre-paid AI capacity and identify opportunities to increase ROI.

**Unused tokens = missed opportunities for velocity, quality, and developer satisfaction.**
